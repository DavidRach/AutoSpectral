\usage{
unmix.autospectral(
  raw.data,
  spectra,
  af.spectra,
  weighted = FALSE,
  weights = NULL,
  calculate.error = FALSE,
  use.dist0 = TRUE
)

unmix.autospectral(
  raw.data,
  spectra,
  af.spectra,
  weighted = FALSE,
  weights = NULL,
  calculate.error = FALSE,
  use.dist0 = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{raw.data}{Expression data from raw fcs files. Cells in rows and
detectors in columns. Columns should be fluorescent data only and must
match the columns in spectra.}

\item{spectra}{Spectral signatures of fluorophores, normalized between 0
and 1, with fluorophores in rows and detectors in columns.}

\item{af.spectra}{Spectral signatures of autofluorescences, normalized
between 0 and 1, with fluorophores in rows and detectors in columns. Prepare
using \code{get.af.spectra}.}

\item{weighted}{Logical, whether to use ordinary or weighted least squares
unmixing as the base algorithm. Default is \code{FALSE} and will use OLS.}

\item{weights}{Optional numeric vector of weights (one per fluorescent
detector). Default is \code{NULL}, in which case weighting will be done by
channel means (Poisson variance). Only used if \code{weighted}.}

\item{calculate.error}{Logical, whether to calculate the RMSE unmixing model
accuracy and include it as an output.}

\item{use.dist0}{Logical, controls whether the selection of the optimal AF
signature for each cell is determined by which unmixing brings the cell
closest to 0 (\code{use.dist0} = \code{TRUE}) or by which unmixing minimizes the
per-cell residual (\code{use.dist0} = \code{FALSE}). Default is \code{TRUE}.}
