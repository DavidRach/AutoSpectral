\arguments{
\item{clean.expr}{List containing cleaned expression data.}

\item{af.removal.sample}{Vector of sample names for which autofluorescence
removal is to be performed.}

\item{spectral.channel}{Vector of spectral channel names.}

\item{peak.channel}{Vector of peak detection channels for fluorophores.}

\item{universal.negative}{Name of the universal negative control.}

\item{asp}{The AutoSpectral parameter list.
Prepare using \code{get.autospectral.param}}

\item{scatter.param}{Vector of scatter parameters.}

\item{negative.n}{Integer. Number of events to include in the downsampled
negative population. Default is \code{500}.}

\item{positive.n}{Integer. Number of events to include in the downsampled
positive population. Default is \code{1000}.}

\item{scatter.match}{Logical, default is \code{TRUE}. Whether to select negative
events based on scatter profiles matching the positive events. Defines a
region of FSC and SSC based on the distribution of selected positive events.}

\item{intermediate.figures}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} returns additional figures to
show the inner workings of the cleaning, including definition of low-AF cell
gates on the PCA-unmixed unstained and spectral ribbon plots of the AF
exclusion from the unstained.}

\item{main.figures}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} creates the main figures to show the
impact of intrusive autofluorescent event removal and scatter-matching for
the negatives.}

\item{parallel}{Logical, default is \code{FALSE}, in which case parallel processing
will not be used. Parallel processing will likely be faster when many small
files are read in. If the data is larger, parallel processing may not
accelerate the process much.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, default is \code{TRUE}. Set to \code{FALSE} to suppress messages.}
}
\value{
A list containing the expression data with autofluorescent events
removed for each sample.

\description{
This function runs the autofluorescence removal process on a list of samples,
using the specified parameters and settings.
