\arguments{
\item{clean.expr}{List containing cleaned expression data.}

\item{samp}{Sample identifier.}

\item{spectral.channel}{Vector of spectral channel names.}

\item{peak.channel}{Vector of peak detection channels for fluorophores.}

\item{universal.negative}{Named vector mapping samples to their matching
negatives.}

\item{asp}{The AutoSpectral parameter list.
Prepare using \code{get.autospectral.param}}

\item{scatter.param}{Vector of scatter parameters.}

\item{negative.n}{Integer. Number of events to include in the downsampled
negative population. Default is \code{500}.}

\item{positive.n}{Integer. Number of events to include in the downsampled
positive population. Default is \code{1000}.}

\item{scatter.match}{Logical, default is \code{TRUE}. Whether to select negative
events based on scatter profiles matching the positive events. Defines a
region of FSC and SSC based on the distribution of selected positive events.}

\item{main.figures}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} creates the main figures to show the
impact of intrusive autofluorescent event removal and scatter-matching for
the negatives.}

\item{intermediate.figures}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} returns additional figures to
show the inner workings of the cleaning, including definition of low-AF cell
gates on the PCA-unmixed unstained and spectral ribbon plots of the AF
exclusion from the unstained.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, default is \code{TRUE}. Set to \code{FALSE} to suppress messages.}
}
\value{
A matrix containing the expression data with autofluorescent events
removed for the sample.
}
\description{
This function removes autofluorescence contamination from a sample, using
the specified parameters and settings.
