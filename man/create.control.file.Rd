\description{
A helper function to draft a description of your single stained
    control files such that AutoSpectral can understand and process them
    correctly. Given a set of single stained control fcs files,
    create.control.file will produce a csv file listing the matching peak
    detector channels for your fluorophores (if known). If your files contain
    bead or cell tags in the filename, it will assign your controls as cells
    or beads. You will need to fill in any "No Match" results manually.
    You will need to set universal negatives manually. You will need to add
    marker names manually.
