```

In this article, we'll try to cover some of the features and tuning for the 
automated gating in AutoSpectral. This was developed by Carlos Roca in AutoSpill,
and has been lightly modified for use in AutoSpectral. To be fair, this is one
of the weaker points, largely because of the immense variability in sample types
that people may have and the even bigger variability in opinions on how to set
up the appearance of your scatter plots. So, a one-size-fits-all approach is 
never going to work.

Gating to identify the correct cells for the single-stained controls is really
important, though. We'll look at common failure points, how to get the gates
to look the way you want and also cover how to skip the gating entirely. For the
latter, you can just import pre-gated files exportedfrom your favorite FCS analysis program.

```{r setup}
library(AutoSpectral)
```

As always, we'll start by loading in the parameters and telling AutoSpectral where the control files are. Today we're going to use a couple samples from the ID7000, largely because this particular machine didn't allow us to set a threshold on scatter without messing up the data, and the FSC gain was maxed out. According to the engineer, nothing was wrong with it (yay! anyway...).

Today I'm including a simple set with a bead control and a cell control for Spark Blue 574 (anti-CD14), with corresponding unstained samples.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
asp <- get.autospectral.param(cytometer = "id7000", figures = TRUE)
control.dir <- "~/AutoSpectral_data/Gating_example/SSC"
create.control.file(control.dir, asp)
```

We get a warning because there are two fluorophores with the same name (two copies of SB574). That's intended to happen, but can probably be changed later. For now, we can disambiguate the two by calling one of the SB574 dyes `SB574 beads` and the other `SB574 cells`. We'll set universal negatives, fill in `CD14` for the marker for both, and change the unstained bead control `Fluorophore` to be `Negative` instead of `AF`.

Once done, we can load in the control file.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
control.file <- "~/AutoSpectral_data/Gating_example/fcs_control_file.csv"
```

Now we are ready to read in the fcs files, gate the cells and organize the 
experiment.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
flow.control <- define.flow.control(control.dir, control.file, asp)
```

Check the gating plots. The ones with lots of numbered points on them are the ones that define the automated gating. These are the most important for troubleshooting. These are done on composite files, aggregated between all samples that have been determined to share the same gate (the gating variables are beads/cells, large/small, viability gate/live cell, so any combination of those).

Gating on the beads:
![Bead gating plot](figures/Gating_example_beads_nonViability_smallGate.jpg)
This is what it is supposed to look like when it is working well. The square `region` gate defines the area around the highest density of events, and the gate border is the smoothed line inside that. In this case, it's pretty clearly picked the bead population (1). Population 2 is bead doublets. Population 3 is debris.

What about the cells? What do we want? We want a gate that includes the monocyte region because we're staining for CD14. Did we get that?

CD14 gating failure 1:
![CD14 monocyte gating plot](figures/Gating_example_failure1.jpg)
Nope. Not even close.

What's going on? AutoSpectral looks for the cells within a boundary (expecting the cells to be up a bit off the axis) and expects there to be a debris/dead cell population in the lower left corner. Neither of these is really true in this case.

The parameters for controlling the search and gate definition are in the functions that create the AutoSpectral parameter list, usually defined, as here, as `asp`.

If we open up the main function, e.g., `View(get_autospectral_param_minimal)`, you can see a lot of these starting at the comment `### gating parameters`.

Let's start with the easiest fix: the target to pick. In this case, AutoSpectral has found our cells (population 1), but it's picking population 2 as the one to use for defining the gate. This is controlled by this parameter:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
asp$gate.bound.density.max.target.cells
```
The target population is (confusingly, but that's the original syntax), one more than this number for cells. So, it picks population 2. If we want it to pick population 1, we can do this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
asp$gate.bound.density.max.target.cells <- 0
flow.control <- define.flow.control(control.dir, control.file, asp)
```

CD14 gating after setting target to 0:
![CD14 monocyte gating plot](figures/Gating_example_target0.jpg)
Cool. Progress.

Now we've got the cells in the boundary, but it's mostly lymphocytes, right? And we've got a monocyte (CD14) control. That's not going to work well. We're going to need a bigger gate.

For that, we return to the control file. Here, we have the option to specify `large.gate` as `TRUE` for each control as we see fit.

Changing the control file:
![Setting large gate](figures/Gating_example_setting_largeGate.jpg)

Okay, trying again:
(We've already set the target to 0 and it stays there until we change it or call `get.autospectral.param` again and overwrite `asp`).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
flow.control <- define.flow.control(control.dir, control.file, asp)
```

With a larger gate set:
![Larger gate](figures/Gating_example_target0_largeGate.jpg)


The large.gate option does something pretty simple--it extends the basic roundish gate upwards and outwards (to the top and to the right). The amount by which it scales upwards and outwards is determined by the parameters below, which are defined on a cytometer-specific basis, so in this case, in `get.autospectral.param.id7000`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
asp$large.gate.scaling.x
asp$large.gate.scaling.y
```
As we see above, the gate's bigger than we need it to be. We could, if we want, make it a bit smaller, like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
asp$large.gate.scaling.x <- 2
asp$large.gate.scaling.y <- 3
flow.control <- define.flow.control(control.dir, control.file, asp)
```

With a medium-sized gate set:
![Medium gate](figures/Gating_example_Target0_mediumGate.jpg)


As you've probably noticed, the gating is pretty slow. This is mostly down to the calculations to determine the density. There are some other ways of doing this that are faster, but less reliable. Happy for any suggestions here.

The parameters that can speed up the gate are below:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
asp$gate.downsample.n.cells
asp$gate.bound.density.grid.n.cells
asp$gate.region.density.grid.n.cells
asp$gate.region.max.density.grid.n.cells
```
The first determines the number of cells to be used for calculating the gates. This number, 100000, is about as low as is reliable, and you may well need more cells if you do not have well-defined density blobs.

The other three determine the grid size for searching for dense populations. Larger grids, bigger search area, so slower. But, also, better definition of the density, which determines both the boundaries and the pseudocolor on the plots. Trying changing them around if you want. Setting the grid.n to 50 often works quite well and is quite a bit faster.

The other factor we'll touch on controls the tightness of the boundary. Basically, we can tune it based on the robust standard deviation of the points in the region (as determined by tiling with Voronoi tessellation). Bigger number, bigger gate.

With all of the parameters, we have a set for beads and a set for cells. This allows us to tune the gates for each separately. For this part, let's tweak the bead gate.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
asp$gate.bound.density.max.mad.factor.beads
asp$gate.bound.density.max.mad.factor.cells
```
By default, the bead gate is set to be a bit looser than the cells (relative to the peak of density in the bead population). Beads are cleaner, so we can be less stringent. Let's be even less strict--what happens?


```{r, eval=FALSE}
asp$gate.bound.density.max.mad.factor.beads <- 10
flow.control <- define.flow.control(control.dir, control.file, asp)
```

Bead gate with MAD = 3:
![Default bead gate](figures/Gating_example_beads_nonViability_smallGate.jpg)

Bead gate with MAD set to 10:
![Altered bead gate](figures/Gating_example_beads_MAD10.jpg)
With this, we expand the final search region (rectangle), but the final gate for the beads is pretty similar due to the sharp cut-off in density around the bead peak.

The other thing we can do to modify the gating is to change the limits on FSC and SSC. This is pretty important for newer cytometers like the BD FACSDiscover and Novocyte Opteon since they have very large dynamic ranges. This makes it hard to get everything on screen and scaled well without some manual intervention. AutoSpectral has default settings on scatter that are specific to each cytometer, but, really, a lot of this is down to personal preferences and the types of samples you're working with. So, let's look at how to change the scales.

First, which scatter parameters are we using?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
asp$default.scatter.parameter
```
For the ID7000, it's FSC-A and SSC-A.

What if I have multiple scatter parameters and want to use something else?

If this were another cytometer's data, we could use a different scatter detector. I've commented this out below, but that's how you'd do it.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# asp$default.scatter.parameter <- c( "FSC-A", "SSC-B-A" )
```

There are lower and upper limits for each scatter parameter. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
asp$scatter.data.min.x
asp$scatter.data.max.x
asp$scatter.data.min.y
asp$scatter.data.max.y
```
The defaults are likely to be the entire dynamic range. For this data, we've got the cells down in the lower left. We can try restricting the range rather than changing the target population:


```{r, eval=FALSE}
asp$gate.bound.density.max.target.cells <- 1

asp$scatter.data.max.x <- 3e5

asp$scatter.data.max.y <- 4e5

flow.control <- define.flow.control(control.dir, control.file, asp)
```

That works pretty well.
Lymphocyte gate with scatter limits changed:
![lymphocyte gate](figures/Gating_example_scatterLimits_smallGate.jpg)

Monocyte-inclusive gate with scatter limits changed:
![Monocyte gate](figures/Gating_example_scatterLimits_largeGate.jpg)

Bead gate with scatter limits changed:
![bead gate](figures/Gating_example_scatterLimits_beads.jpg)

And, finally, we can just skip gating all together. For this, you'll probably want to gate first in FlowJo, FCS Express, SpectroFlo, etc. Note that with FlowJo, this can occasionally mess up your files and will almost certainly re-order your fluorescence detectors in alphabetical order. The re-ordering can be a nuisance for plotting the spectra (curves are all out of order) and for unmixing if your detectors from the pre-gated controls are inconsistent with the names in the files to be unmixed. Anyway, these are problems with FlowJo, so maybe try a different program.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
flow.control <- define.flow.control(control.dir, control.file, asp, gate = FALSE)
```

So much faster! We don't get plots because we aren't changing anything and you should have already looked at the data before you did this.
