```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(AutoSpectral)
```

To start, we need to get the relevant parameters for the cytometer. This tells
AutoSpectral a lot about what you're doing. In this example, we'll use data from
the Cytek Aurora.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
asp <- get.autospectral.param(cytometer = "aurora", figures = TRUE)
```

Create a folder containing only the single-stained control FCS files describe 
the path to that folder here.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
control.dir <- "~/AutoSpectral_data/Aurora_example/Aurora_controls"
```

With this information, we can create a draft of the control file. More detail 
on this will be included in a separate article. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
create.control.file(control.dir, asp)
```

For now, we'll use the pre-filled control file, which you can get from Mendeley 
Data at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/xzt3h3gnx9/1
```{r, eval=FALSE}
control.file <- "~/AutoSpectral_data/Aurora_example/aurora_fcs_control_file.csv"
```

Now we are ready to read in the fcs files, gate the cells and organize the 
experiment.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
flow.control <- define.flow.control(control.dir, control.file, asp)
```

Check the gating plots.

CD14 monocyte gating:

There are several parameters that control the automated gating. This will be
covered in a separate article.

Control cleaning is always recommended. The default option downsamples and sets 
universal negatives, provided these are specified in the control file. More 
detail on this in a separate article.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
flow.control <- clean.controls(flow.control, asp)
```

This generates scatter-matching plots showing the FSC/SSC of the positive events
and events from the universal negative in the same region.

Spectra can now be isolated from the controls. To use the cleaned data, set 
`use.clean.expr` to `TRUE`.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
spectra <- get.fluorophore.spectra(flow.control, asp, use.clean.expr = TRUE)
```

Check the spectral traces and heatmaps--do they look right?

Now we can unmix.
In this example we're just going to cover basic unmixing using ordinary least 
squares, which is what you'll get in SpectroFlo on the Aurora. By default, 
AutoSpectral extracts a single AF parameter, much like selecting the "spectral 
unmixing with autofluorescence extraction" option. To unmix without AF extraction, 
remove this from the spectral matrix:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
fluorophore.only.spectra <- spectra[rownames(spectra) != "AF", ]
```

We can unmix a single FCS file:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
unmix.fcs("~/AutoSpectral_data/Aurora_example/Aurora_fully_stained/E1 Fresh_100ul_TS_BS_005.fcs",
          spectra, asp, flow.control, method = "OLS")
```

Or, if we have a bunch of files in the folder, we can unmix them all:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
unmix.folder("~/AutoSpectral_data/Aurora_example/AutoSpectral/Aurora_fully_stained/",
             spectra, asp, flow.control, method = "OLS")
```

By default, parallel processing is off. To activate it for faster unmixing, set:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
asp$parallel <- TRUE
```

Do this before calling the function, e.g., `define.flow.control` or 
`clean.controls.` Turn it off again at any point:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
asp$parallel <- FALSE
```
